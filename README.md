OpenFrameworks Solar System Simulation

After a particularlly good day in programing class I decided that I wanted to write a program that draws an accurate model of our solar system. Enter this Project:

My (eventual) plans for this program are:
1) Draw all 9 planets, to scale, with appropriate tilt (pluto stil counts. no one likes the IAU) with accurate skins
2) Animate the orbit of each planet, to scale, with apppropriate tilt
3) Integrate the ability to change the speeds with respect to "normal"
4) Draw some moons.
5) Integrate a GoTo function for a specific date/time
