OpenFrameworks Solar System Simulation

After a particularly good day in programing class I decided that I wanted to write a program that draws an accurate model of our solar system. Enter this Project:

My (eventual) plans for this program are:
* Draw all 9 planets, to scale, with appropriate tilt (pluto still counts. no one likes the IAU) and accurate skins
* Animate the orbit of each planet, to scale, with appropriate tilt.
* Integrate the ability to change the speeds with respect to "normal."
* Draw some moons.
* Integrate a GoTo function for a specific date/time.
